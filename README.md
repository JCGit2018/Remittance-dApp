An Ethereum decentralized application that allows a contributor to store funds for a beneficiary within a "lockbox".  The beneficiary may then claim the funds so long as they are withdrawn before the lockblox claim deadline, while using valid credentials.  Two factor authentication protects the lockbox funds and the contributor does not submit passwords to the underlying smart contract in the clear.  The contributor may also reclaim the funds once the deadline for a lockbox has elapsed.  Administrative features such as emergency stop, deadline configuration, owner fee configuration, and emergency fund recovery; are also supported by the smart contract.
